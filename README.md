# gdpr-word-game
Find GDPR in the generated matrix

## Usage
Create a virtual environment and install the requirements.txt

`python3 hello.py`

### GDPR
`localhost:5000`

### Different word or acronym (e.g. test)
`localhost:5000/word/test`

## Why?
This project was created in honor of all the wrongly spelled gdpr references.
And simply because I wanted to see how hard it was to create a basic python website.
